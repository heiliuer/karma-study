1.  什么是karma

    > karma 是google开源的前端测试框架（旧名 Testacular ）,
    基于nodejs，可以便捷的将javascript测试用例各种浏览器中运行测试，并分析返回测试结果
    ---
    > The main goal for Karma is to bring a productive testing environment to developers. 
    The environment being one where they don't have to set up loads of configurations, 
    but rather a place where developers can just write the code and get instant feedback from their tests.
     Because getting quick feedback is what makes you productive and creative.
